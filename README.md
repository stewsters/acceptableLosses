Backstory
=========
Humanity began expanding across the system.  Eventually 

During the First Colonial War the combatants targeted each other's colonies with high velocity cannons.  Being unable to 
move and without atmosphere to protect them from the bombardment, asteroid colonies were easy targets.
Without any hope of resupply cut off many ships and colonies died off or turned to cannabalism.  It was pretty traumatic.

After the war, to convince civilians that they should again work to colonize asteroids a pact was signed that forbid the 
targeting of neutral stations without armaments.


The requirements were:

1) The station may not have any long range exterior weapons that would allow it to be used in war.

2) The station must be civilian owned, no exclusive military bases.

3) Warships must maintain a distance to the colony, they cannot hide within it.  This is to prevent accidental
destruction from missed shots.  The warships may use small transport craft to ferry supplies.


The protections were:

1) The station may not be bombarded with long range weapons or anti ship fire.

2) Anyone looking to take control of the station must board it.


You are a small group of colonists that got dropped off at this asteroid by a passing ship.  You must dig in and make it 
habitable before your supplies run out.
